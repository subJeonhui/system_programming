IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ATTITUDE, INTERESTING PROBLEMS WILL FIND YOU.
TREATING YOUR USERS AS CO-DEVELOPERS IS YOUR LEAST-HASSLE ROUTE TO RAPID CODE IMPROVEMENT AND EFFECTIVE DEBUGGING.
GIVEN A LARGE ENOUGH BETA-TESTER AND CO-DEVELOPER BASE, ALMOST EVERY PROBLEM WILL BE CHARACTERIZED QUICKLY 
SMART DATA STRUCTURES AND DUMB CODE WORKS A LOT BETTER THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
THEY WILL RESPOND BY BECOMING YOUR MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE.
SOMETIMES THE LATTER IS BETTER.
PERFECTION (IN DESIGN) IS ACHIEVED NOT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO ADD, 
ANY TOOL SHOULD BE USEFUL IN THE EXPECTED WAY, BUT A TRULY GREAT TOOL LENDS ITSELF TO USES YOU NEVER EXPECTED.
AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLEâ€”AND NEVER THROW AWAY INFORMATION UNLESS THE RECIPIENT FORCES YOU TO!
A SECURITY SYSTEM IS ONLY AS SECURE AS ITS SECRET. BEWARE OF PSEUDO-SECRETS.

WHEN O'REILLY MEDIA PUBLISHED THE BOOK IN 1999 IT BECAME ONE OF, IF NOT THE FIRST, COMPLETE, 

JIMMY WALES HIMSELF WAS INSPIRED BY THE WORK (AS WELL AS ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD IN PRE-INTERNET WORKS,

IN 1999 NIKOLAI BEZROUKOV PUBLISHED TWO CRITICAL ESSAYS ON ERIC RAYMOND'S VIEWS OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, 
THEY PRODUCED A SHARP RESPONSE FROM ERIC RAYMOND.
